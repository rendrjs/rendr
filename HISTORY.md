# 0.5.0
## 2013-12-20
* Fix serverSide redirectTo with rootPath != default.
* [breaking] Removed use of `options.emulateJSON` and `options.data` in `clientSync`
* [breaking] Removed `addApiParams` from `syncer`
* Many more tests.
* [breaking] Moved `AppView` to `client/` from `shared/`.
* [breaking] Added support for AMD (RequireJS), which resulted in many methods
  becoming asynchronous instead of synchronous (`Fetcher`, `BaseView`,
  `ModelUtils`, etc.
* [breaking] Removed global `entryPath`; no longer referencing `rendr` as a
  global.
* [breaking] Refactored server code to greatly reduce amount of boilerplate
  needed to set up a Rendr app. Rendr now owns its own Express app, which can
  be mounted on existing Express apps as a simple middleware.
* [breaking] `server/server.js` now exports a class constructor rather than a
  singleton.
* [breaking] Removed unused `ServerRouter#stashError()` method.
* [breaking] `modelUtils` object is now `ModelUtils` class.
* Added `DataAdapter` base class and fleshed-out `RestAdapter`, which is the
  default `DataAdapter` used by a Rendr server.
* More flexibility with placement Rendr app files within an Express project.
  app, and support for multiple Rendr apps in a single Express app.

  function, which takes `req` and `res` as arguments.

  view hydration.
* Attach `req` to `App` instance on the server-side.
* Switched default CommonJS packaging to Browserify from Stitch.
* Added `examples/` dir, deprecating separate `rendr-app-template` project.
* Fix bug where resources fetched by the `Fetcher` using spec keys other than
  `model` or `collection` would be not hydrated properly by `BaseView`.
* Don't intercept clicked links if 'shift' or 'meta' keys pressed.
* Make it easier to use custom `AppView` class.
* Add support for RegExp routes.
* Only attempt to use `pushState` to redirect if the path matches one of the
  app's routes.
* Trigger `action:error` event in `ClientRouter` if there was an error caught
  while running a controller's action.
* Allow customizing the app's root path.
* Added better support for `options.error` callback for `Backbone.sync()` in
  the client-side.
* Automatically add `X-Forwarded-For` header in `apiProxy` middleware.
* Support using functions for `BaseView#id`, `BaseView#className`, and
  `BaseView#tagName`.
* Support passing `options.status` to `ServerRouter#redirectTo()`.
* Use `sanitizer` module instead of un-maintained `validator` module for XSS
  protection.
* Update versions of dependencies: `underscore`, `qs`, `request`.
* Much more unit tests.
* Added Istanbul code coverage tool.
